Summary:
> I like Edison and think the would be a great to work with.  He's been working at the same retail store
in Japan Town since 2009 and has been learning to program on the side.  He's been to meetups before and
seems passionate about making cool things.  Slight red flag is that he said he's easily influenced by the people around him
He said that this is why he wasn't successful in college.  However, he seems to have been working to surround himself with people that are motivated and it's definitely been helping him.
