Summary:
> Connor seemed like a good candidate.  He was pre-med but realized it wasn't for him.
Took a job as a medical scribe and enjoyed working with the software they were using.
Thought of a lot of ways that he could make it better so he started to learn Python.
Hit on a lot of the points that I was looking for.
He seemed well prepared for the interview.  He has some background in coding with Python and C++.

Overall, solid interview.
